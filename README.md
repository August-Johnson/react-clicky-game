# WEEK 19 - CLICKY GAME

<p>This week's homework assignment was to create a memory card game using React. The user is diplayed an assortment of cards (4x3) and click on each one to score a point. If the user clicks a card they have already clicked before, they lose the game and their score is reset back to 0.</p>

## CHALLENGES
Dealing with the state and modifying it.
I was running into issues where I thought I was keeping the original state of the card array being imported, but in reality I was changing it and reassigning values and properties. I thought that because I made 2 copies of the same value, that one could be changed and wouldn't affect the other.<br /><br />

### Example: <br />
{ <br />
originalArray: cardArray, <br />
arrayToChange: cardArray <br />
}
<hr />
<br />

But whenever I modified the values of arrayToChange, it would modify the value of cardArray directly and update the originalArray state.
Looking into it led me to read about mutable and immutable values.

# CREATE-REACT-APP DEFAULT BOILERPLATE INFO
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
